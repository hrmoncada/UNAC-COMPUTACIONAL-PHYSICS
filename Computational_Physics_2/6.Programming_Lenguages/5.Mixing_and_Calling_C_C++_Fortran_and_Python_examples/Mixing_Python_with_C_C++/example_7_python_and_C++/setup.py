The setup.py file is a Python file which indicates that the installation module/package is most likely packed and distributed using Distutils, the Python Module distribution standard. It specifies the contents of a module to Distutils so that it may execute the appropriate actions (such as locating dependencies) during the moduleâ€™s first installation. The setup.py is a Python script typically included with Python-written libraries or apps. Its objective is to ensure that the program is installed correctly.

$ python3 setup.py build
