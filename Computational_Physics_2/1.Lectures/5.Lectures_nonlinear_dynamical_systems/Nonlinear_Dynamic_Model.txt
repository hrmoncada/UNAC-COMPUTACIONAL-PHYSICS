Python Programs for Nonlinear Dynamics

https://galileo-unbound.blog/table-of-contents/python-programs-for-nonlinear-dynamics/


Using a terminal:
python -c "import scipy; print(scipy.__version__)"

Using a program:
import scipy
print scipy.__version__    # python2
print (scipy.__version__)  # python3
