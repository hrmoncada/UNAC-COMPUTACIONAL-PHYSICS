Serial to Parallel: A Monte Carlo Operation
==================================

This tutorial covers how to write a parallel program to calculate Ï€ using the Monte Carlo method with MPI and OpenMP. 

####Compiling and Running
Before you start, you will need to edit the submit scripts (submit.pbs and mpisubmit.pbs) and the Makefile and replace <PROJID> with the correct project ID. Once done, you need to load the PGI programming environment

```
module load PrgEnv-pgi
```

To compile and submit the serial version, you need to run: ```make serial```

* For the MPI_Reduce verion: `make mpi`
* For the MPI Send/Recv verion: `make mpisr`
* For the OpenMP version: `make omp`
* For the hybrid OpenMP/MPI version: `make mpiomp`

The output should look something like:

```

Application 3587838 resources: utime ~0s, stime ~0s, Rss ~3444, inblocks ~4534, outblocks ~11970
```
